After two days of research, re-styling, and re-configuration, this development blog is finally ready for it's first "non-test" post!

## Developed Using:
+ GitHub Pages and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) 
+ [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole), the Jekyll Butler by Mark Otto 
+ The [Hyde Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/poole/hyde), again by Mark Otto. 
+ Color and opacity styles were taken from [my personal website](http://www.bethanywatson.me)

## Why Jekyll and Hyde?
While I could have developed a blog app from scratch or mounted a blogging engine onto my existing Rails website, I wanted the focus of my development blog to be on the content --  not its development. Because Jekyll and GitHub pages are so well integrated, this combination seemed like a good choice for a blog with low overhead. 

I went with a premade theme -- Hyde -- for the same reason; I wanted to get up and running quickly without too much front-end fiddling.

## What's next?
An infusion of content!

When spinning things up, I made a few front-end customizations and added "categories" to posts. The first development post will go over some of these customizations.

Going forward, expect additional posts following development milestones for some of my other personal projects, as well as some Today I Learned tidbits.

Thanks for reading! Looking forward to writing,
Beth
